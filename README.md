Portfolio Performance Tracker

Goal: 
Create a (hopefully) pretty basic portfolio tracker with user interface with the help of python (and yfinance as an API to retrieve market data) for backend and Angular for the frontend to visualize graphs for portfolio performance. 
Eventually, I am hoping this project can evolve into a more complex software that allows backtesting of strategies and maybe even the execution of trading algorithms.
